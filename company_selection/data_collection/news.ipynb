       "  'article_text': 'This virtual dog is barking.\\n\\nThe crypto known as dogecoin, created back in 2013 as a joke, has been rising to record levels, highlighting a renewed fervor this year for virtual assets that increasingly draw the interest of celebrities, some institutional investors and corporate officials.\\n\\nOn Monday, dogecoin boasted a market value of nearly $10.5 billion, up 107% over the past seven days, according to CoinMarketCap.com, which provides data on digital assets.\\n\\nThat puts the virtual coin — pronounced “dōj-coin” and sharing the doge name with the elected magistrate of such historical city-states as Venice and Genoa but commonly associated with a popular meme featuring a shiba inu dog — in the top 10 among crypto assets, with bitcoin BTCUSD, +11.17% weighing in at No. 1 at a value of $810 billion.\\n\\nA single dogecoin was valued at 8.1 cents, up around 30% on Monday; back in late January it was changing hands at less than a penny, costing 0.007 cent as of Jan. 27.\\n\\nCoinMarketCap.com\\n\\nWhile dogecoin isn’t a virtual asset that is considered to have a utility — a point that could be argued for a number of cryptos — it has been given fresh life after Tesla Inc. TSLA, +0.61% CEO Elon Musk in late December tweeted this simple, cryptic message via Twitter: “One word: Doge.”\\n\\nMusk’s subsequent bullish tweets about dogecoin appeared to further catalyze a rally in the crypto.\\n\\nOn Sunday, the Tesla and SpaceX leader wrote:\\n\\nDogecoin co-founder Billy Markus told the Wall Street Journal in an article at the beginning of February that he created the asset in 2012 as a “lighthearted cryptocurrency,” then known as Bells, to serve as the fun version of bitcoin.\\n\\nAccording to the newspaper, fellow dogecoin co-founder Jackson Palmer shared his idea for a cryptocurrency based on the shiba inu meme, and Markus reconfigured his code for Bells to fit the meme.\\n\\nMarkus reportedly told the Journal that dogecoin’s rally to records “doesn’t make sense,” and equated it to the recent fervor on social-media platforms, like Reddit’s WallStreetBets, that helped drive shares of GameStop Corp. GME, -8.50% and AMC Entertainment Holdings AMC, -12.00% to stratospheric heights, until those speculative short-selling-amplified bets cooled considerably.\\n\\nMore recently, however, the likes of rapper Snoop Dogg, whose real name is Calvin Broadus, and Gene Simmons of the rock band Kiss joined Musk — and billionaire investor Mark Cuban — in weighing in on dogecoin.\\n\\nSimmons referred to himself as the God of Dogecoin, on a Twitter TWTR, +1.48% account associated with him:\\n\\nBroadus tweeted an image of the shiba inu on Saturday:\\n\\nSo is dogecoin worth all the attention?\\n\\nExperts in crypto say investors should be operating with more than a modicum of caution.\\n\\n“These are strange times with elements of ochlocracy manifesting as populism — from the Capitol Hill to GameStop,” Charles Hayter, CEO of London-based research site CryptoCompare, told MarketWatch.\\n\\n“People are moving markets en masse and are playing greater fool with each other without understanding the ramifications or their own psychological limitations,” the researcher added.\\n\\nBullish bitcoin investors make the case that price gains in bitcoin, the world’s No. 1 cryptocurrency, are supported by the limited supply of the crypto that is inherent in its code. Only 21 million bitcoin will ever exist, and so-called mining for bitcoin, or solving complex computational problems that are rewarded by bitcoin, become harder as time goes on. The final cache of bitcoins likely are not going to be mined until around 2140.\\n\\nThe supply of dogecoin, on the other hand, has no built-in limit, with the number of dogecoin that can be mined at any given time varying from one to hundreds of thousands.\\n\\nNonetheless, interest in dogecoins underscores the appetite for alternative assets in an environment where 0% interest rates are prevalent as governments around the world attempt to mitigate the economic harm from the COVID-19 pandemic.\\n\\nDogecoin’s price has surged over 1,600% since its recent lows. Bitcoin is up some 48% so far this year, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.46% has advanced 2.3%. The S&P 500 index SPX, +0.37% climbed nearly 4% in 2021 thus far.\\n\\nCuban, who has maintained a less euphoric view on bitcoin as well as dogecoin, said the recent moves in cryptos can serve as inexpensive teaching moments for newbie investors. He said the rise in dogecoins serves as a teaching tool for his son, citing an interview with Forbes in a tweet on Monday.\\n\\nForbes quoted Cuban as saying this of dogecoin: “[L]iterally, and I say this with all seriousness, it’s the best entertainment bang for your buck available.”\\n\\n“You can buy $1 worth or $10 worth and have fun watching it all day every day,” Cuban said.\\n\\nTo be sure, some investors may not find cryptos as much fun, particularly if they end up barking up the wrong tree when it comes to dogecoin.\\n\\n“Musk’s musings are interesting, and he can be controversial — however, it’s peoples individual interpretations and actions that are at fault,” Hayter said.'},\n",

       "  'article_text': 'A highflying stock market is reminding nervous investors of the 2000 dot-com bubble burst, but they might be better off studying more recent history, analysts said.\\n\\nIt is important to remember “that current Fed policy, absolute interest rates, the yield curve, credit trends and money availability are in a very different place than in 1999-2000,” wrote Tony Dwyer, chief market strategist at Canaccord Genuity, in a Monday note.\\n\\nIn addition, high valuations — measures of a stocks price relative to other metrics such as earnings — are being gauged against last year’s pandemic-inspired trough in profit rather than building on record earnings, as was the case in 2000, he said.\\n\\nDwyer said 2021 could instead play out more like the postcrisis scenario seen in 2010, which would point the way to a “solid year” for the market, but with a bumpy ride thanks to “multiple first-half corrections” along with a compression in price-to-earnings ratios that is likely to come from a historic surge in earnings per share rather than something more onerous.\\n\\nDwyer highlighted how the S&P 500 SPX, +0.37% move off its March 23 pandemic low has echoed the index’s rebound off its March 2009 low (see chart below).\\n\\nCanaccord Genuity\\n\\nThrough the Feb. 2 close — 218 days after the March 23 low — the S&P 500 was up 71%. In the 218 days after the March 9, 2009, low, the index rose 70%, according to Dow Jones Market Data.\\n\\nAt this point in the post-2009 playbook, the S&P 500 began a pullback. This time around, the S&P 500 has continued to march higher, logging back-to-back record finishes on Thursday and Friday and was up 0.4% in early afternoon trade on Monday.\\n\\nAfter a late January wobble tied to the trading frenzy around GameStop Corp. GME, -8.31% , stocks have enjoyed a broad February rally. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.45% was up around 150 points, or 0.5%, on Monday, on track to top its record close from Jan. 20.\\n\\nDataTrek Research co-founder Nicholas Colas, who has regularly highlighted the “2009 playbook” since the March lows, noted last week that the 2010 pullback was pretty much a “textbook” affair, with the S&P 500 falling 8.2% over 13 trading days. The index recovered over the following 30 trading days, ending March 2010 at new highs, he said.\\n\\nColas said the observation wasn’t “so much a trading call as an illustration of what happens as we get deeper into a cyclical recovery.”\\n\\nHe noted that the 2020 chart has diverged from the 2009 path several times and might continue to do so in 2021, but argued that with so many observers looking for a pullback, the playbook might offer guidance “on what to expect and where to start buying.”\\n\\nMeanwhile, Dwyer highlighted another echo of 2010. He noted that since the start of earnings season, according to Refinitiv data, fourth-quarter 2020 year-over-year earnings have improved by 11.9 percentage points (from -10.3% to +1.6%), the fifth-largest improvement on record dating back to the third quarter of 2002 and matched only by the 2009-10 recovery.\\n\\nRead: The S&P 500 is on track for surprise earnings growth'},\n",

Trading volume was just 17.4 million shares a little after midday, compared with the full-day average of about 53.2 million over the past 30 days. The drop in price and volume comes after the stock plunged 80.4% last week, the biggest weekly drop in the stock's public history.
